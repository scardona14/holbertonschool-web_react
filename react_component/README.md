# React Component

## Description

This project focuses on creating and testing **React components** using both **Class** and **Function components**. It also covers optimization techniques, testing components, and understanding **Higher Order Components (HOCs)**, **pure components**, and **component lifecycle**.

In this project, you will:
- Learn how to create React components using both **class-based** and **functional components**.
- Understand the lifecycle of **class components**.
- Test components using **Jest** and verify function calls with **Jest spies**.
- Learn how to pass **props** and **children** to components.
- Learn to optimize your components and prevent unnecessary renders.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- When to use a **Class** or a **Function** to create a component.
- The lifecycle of a **Class component** (including methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, etc.).
- How to **test a component** using Jest.
- How to use a **Jest spy** to verify that a function is being called correctly.
- What a **Higher-Order Component (HOC)** is and how to use it.
- How to **optimize performance** and control which components to render.

## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **node 20.x.x** and **npm 10.x.x**.
- Allowed editors: **vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code**.
- All your files should end with a **new line**.
- A **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Install Jest globally: `npm install -g jest`.

## Tasks

In this project, you will complete various tasks related to React components. These tasks will help you understand the following:

- How to create **functional** and **class-based** components.
- The differences between a **pure component** and a regular component.
- How to pass **children** props to components.
- The usage of **Jest** for testing your components and verifying function calls.
- How to create and use **Higher Order Components (HOCs)** to enhance your components.
- Techniques to **optimize performance** and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

---

## Testing and Validation

- You will be required to write tests for your components. Use **Jest** to check the functionality of your React components.
- Tests should verify that:
  - Components render correctly.
  - Functions are being called when expected.
  - Prop changes are correctly handled.
  - HOCs are applied properly.
  - Performance optimizations (like `React.memo`, `shouldComponentUpdate`) are working.
